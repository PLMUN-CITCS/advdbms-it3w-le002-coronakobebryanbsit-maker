# **202501-ADVDBMS-LE002**
Week 04 - SQL Data Definition Language

Laboratory # 02 - Guided Coding Exercise: Creating and Modifying a Table

## **Instructions**

### **Step 1.1: Accept the Assignment**

   1. Click on the assignment link provided by your instructor.
   2. GitHub Classroom will create a **private repository** under your GitHub account.
   3. After the repository is created, click **"Go to Repository"** to view your assignment.

---

### **Step 1.2: Setup your Git Environment**
Only perform this if this is the first time you will setup your Git Environment

   1. Create a GitHub Account:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/signup?source=login
   ```
      
   2. Download and Install Git on your Laptop/Desktop:
   ```bash
   https://git-scm.com/downloads
   ```
   
   3. Create a Folder in your Laptop/Desktop
   4. Right-click anywhere in the created folder and select "Open Git Bash Here".
   5. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git name, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```
   
   6. In the Git Bash Terminal, set your git email, perform command:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```
   
   7. Create your SSH Key, just follow the instructions, no need to provide filename and passphrase. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
   ```
   
   8. Copy your SSH Keys into clipboard. In the Git Bash Terminal, perform command:
   ```bash
   clip < ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
   
   9. Log in to your GitHub account.
   10. In the upper-right corner of GitHub, click your profile picture and select Settings.
   11. In the left sidebar, click on SSH and GPG keys.
   12. Click the New SSH key button.
   13. In the Title field, give the key a recognizable name (e.g., "My Windows Laptop").
   14. In the Key field, CTRL + V or paste the keys copied into your clipboard. Save the key.
   15. Go Back to terminal, use command:
   ```bash
   ssh -T git@github.com
   ```

### **Step 2: Clone the Repository to Your Local Machine**

   1. On your repository page, click the green **"Code"** button.
   2. Copy the repository URL (choose HTTPS for simplicity).
   3. Open your terminal (or Git Bash, Command Prompt, or PowerShell) and run:
   
   ```bash
   git clone <git_repo_url>
   ```
   
   4. Navigate into the cloned folder:
   
   ```bash
   cd <git_cloned_folder>
   ```

### **Step 3: Complete the Assignment**

**Laboratory # 04 - Guided Coding Exercise: Creating and Modifying a Tablee**

   **Objective:**
   Practice creating a table with various SQL data types and constraints, then altering its structure by adding a new column. This exercise reinforces SQL DDL (Data Definition Language) commands.

   **Folder Structure:**
   ```
   university_db/
   ├── create_students_table.sql
   └── alter_students_table.sql
   ```

   **File Naming Convention:**
   - `create_students_table.sql`: Contains the SQL statement for creating the `Students` table.
   - `alter_students_table.sql`: Contains the SQL statement for altering the `Students` table.

   **Notable Observations (to be discussed after completing the exercise):**
   - Data Types Matter: You've used INT, VARCHAR, and DATE. But remember, there's a whole world of data types out there! Explore TEXT, BOOLEAN, DATETIME, even spatial types. Choosing the right data type is crucial for efficient storage and data integrity.
   - Constraints are Your Friends: PRIMARY KEY and NOT NULL are just the beginning. UNIQUE, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints help enforce data rules and relationships. Master these, and you'll prevent bad data from ever entering your tables.
   - Auto-Increment Gotchas: Pay close attention to how your database system handles auto-incrementing columns. MySQL uses AUTO_INCREMENT, PostgreSQL has SERIAL, and SQL Server uses IDENTITY. Little syntax differences can trip you up!
   - ALTER TABLE is Powerful: You've added a column, but ALTER TABLE can do so much more! Modify existing columns, add or drop constraints—it's a Swiss Army knife for database maintenance.
   - Think Like a Designer: Creating a table is just the first step. Now, think about the data you'll store in it. How will you populate it? What queries will you run? This is where the real fun begins!

   **SQL Script Best Practices**
   - Idempotency is King: Write scripts that can be run multiple times without causing errors. Check if a column exists before adding it. This saves you headaches down the line.
   - Comments, Comments, Comments: Never underestimate the power of good comments. Explain your code, especially when you're learning. Future you will thank you.
   - Database-Specific Syntax: SQL can be a bit like a dialect. Always double-check the syntax for your specific database system. Don't assume MySQL and PostgreSQL are identical twins!

   **Step-by-Step Instructions:**

   1. Setting up the Environment
      - Ensure you have a SQL database management system installed (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server). This exercise will use generic SQL syntax, but you might need to adjust slightly depending on your specific DBMS.
      - If you haven't already, execute the `create_and_use_db.sql` script from the previous exercise to create and select the `UniversityDB` database. This ensures your new table is created in the correct database.
      - Create the two SQL files as shown in the folder structure above within the `university_db` directory.
      
   2. `create_students_table.sql` (Create Students Table):
      - Open `create_students_table`.sql in a text editor.
      - Create the Database:
      ```SQL
      Use `UniversityDB`;

      -- Step 1: Create the Students table with constraints
      CREATE TABLE `Students` (
         `StudentID` INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,  -- MySQL Example: AUTO_INCREMENT
         -- For other databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server) you might use SERIAL or IDENTITY
         `FirstName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         `LastName` VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
         `EnrollmentDate` DATE
      );

      ```
      
      - Important Note: The `AUTO_INCREMENT` keyword is specific to MySQL. Other database systems have different ways of handling auto-incrementing primary keys:
         - PostgreSQL: `SERIAL` or `BIGSERIAL` data types. Example: `StudentID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY`
         - SQL Server: IDENTITY(1,1) Example: StudentID INT IDENTITY(1,1) PRIMARY KEY
         - Consult the documentation for your specific database for the correct syntax.
      
   3. `alter_students_table.sql` (Alter Students Table):
      - Open `alter_students_table.sql` in a text editor.
      - Alter the table:
      ```SQL
      Use `UniversityDB`;

      -- Step 2: Alter the table to add an Email column
      ALTER TABLE `Students`
      ADD `Email` VARCHAR(100);

      ```
      - Save the `alter_students_table.sql` file.

   4. Executing the SQL Scripts:
      - Open your SQL client and connect to the `UniversityDB` database.
      - Create Table: Execute the `create_students_table.sql` script. This will create the `Students` table.
      - Alter Table: Execute the `alter_students_table.sql` script. This will add the `Email` column to the `Students` table.

### **Step 4: Push Changes to GitHub**
Once you've completed your changes, follow these steps to upload your work to your GitHub repository.

1. Check the status of your changes:
   Open the terminal and run:
   
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   This command shows any modified or new files.
   
2. Stage the changes:
   Add all modified files to staging:
   
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   
3. Commit your changes:
   Write a meaningful commit message:
   
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Submitting ADVDBMS Week 04 - Session 01 - Exercise 02"
   ```
   
4. Push your changes to GitHub:
   Upload your changes to your remote repository:
   
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
